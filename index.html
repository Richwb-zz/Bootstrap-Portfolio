					<h2>The Coder With-in</h2>
					<p>After developing an interest in computers at an early age I have made in my life's goal to grow with technology and follow the trends, that is what has led me to this junction in life. After years of self-taught HTML, CSS, PhP and other web development languages I realized I was missing the vital link to turn websites from static pages with databases to breathing entities, javascript. I decided to take the plunge into a language i always shyed away from to become a full stack developer. I also knew that self teaching can only go so far and sometimes you fight yourself so I decided to enroll in a Javascript bootcamp to give me that extra push I needed.</p>

					<p>You will find in this site my portfolio encompassing all that I have learned during my time at the bootcamp, along with materials that I have learned on my own along the way. My skills and abilities have grown stronger and stronger to develop a wide range of javascript and node.js based entities readying myself for my future career and further expand my horizons in this limitless field.</p>

					<h2>The Person Behind the Code</h2>
				
					<p> It's hard to grow up in north-western NJ and not loving to be outdoors, after all you can't get anywhere without a car or bicycle. While I can fairly say I certainly spent a good deal of time playing video games and tinkering on my computer it is nice to get away from it all every once and a while and explorer ones on backwoods til dusk falls. More recently I have taken a joy in  <a href="https://www.geocaching.org">Geocaching</a> and Scuba diving. Nothing beats the thrill of being underwater in near complete silence. I've always had a love of the water swimming, Kayaking, scuba diving. I should move to Florida...</p>
				
					<p> Should you have any questions for me or interested in my work please feel free to conact me via the contact form one of my profiles to the right.</p>
